10. User Function Templates.

    Let's expand on the idea of "User Function Templates" for the Powershell Awesome Framework (PAF). User Function Templates would provide users with predefined structures for creating specific types of functions, streamlining the process of writing new functions for common tasks. Here's how it could work:

    1. **Template Library**: The PAF would include a library of predefined templates, covering a range of common use cases, such as file manipulation, network operations, data processing, etc.

    2. **Template Selection**: When a user decides to create a new function, they can choose from a list of available templates. Each template would be named and briefly described to help users pick the right one.

    3. **Auto-Generated Code**: Once a user selects a template, the PAF would automatically generate the initial code structure for that function. This code would contain placeholders for specific parameters and logic relevant to the selected template.

    4. **Parameter Guidance**: Templates would come with predefined parameters, and the PAF would provide guidance on what each parameter represents and how to use them effectively.

    5. **Customization and Expansion**: Users can then customize the auto-generated code by filling in the placeholders with their specific logic and adjusting parameters as needed.

    6. **Template Updates**: As the PAF evolves, new templates can be added, and existing templates can be updated to reflect the latest best practices and improvements.

    *Example*:
    Suppose a user wants to create a function for copying files from one location to another. They would access the "User Function Templates" menu in the PAF, find the "File Copy" template, and select it. The PAF would then generate the initial function structure with source and destination file parameters and basic error handling. The user can then add specific file manipulation logic within the function's structure.

    *Benefits*:

    - **Time-Saving**: User Function Templates save time by providing ready-made function structures, reducing the effort required to start coding from scratch.
    - **Consistency**: Templates ensure a consistent structure across functions, making it easier for users to understand and maintain their codebase.
    - **Guidance**: The templates offer built-in guidance, helping users understand the purpose and usage of each parameter, promoting best practices.
    - **Efficiency**: Users can quickly create powerful functions without worrying about boilerplate code, increasing overall productivity.
